				Paula Scher was born on October 6, 1948 in Washington, DC. Not too long after, her family moved to Maryland and Scher grew up in the suburbs. Scher was creating art for as long as she could remember. She never fit in very well in high school because while she was in the art room, everyone else was at the football game.
