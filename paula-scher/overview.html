			<br>
				Paula Scher was born on October 6, 1948, in Washington, DC. Not too long after, her family moved to Maryland and Scher grew up in the suburbs. Scher was creating art for as long as she could remember. She never fit in very well in high school because while she was in the art room, everyone else was at the football game. It wasn't until she was 10 years old that she discovered her art passion because she had to eliminate other aspirations. Scher says, "I knew, but I didn't know what a graphic designer was. I also wanted to be a singer-dancer-piano player-bareback rider." In highschool, she became drawn to art after being influenced by contemporary album covers, such as the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper and Revolver and Cream's Disraeli Gears. Scher ultimately chose to pursue graphic design in college because she felt that she was bad at everything else art-related, such as fine arts and crafts.

			<p style="padding-bottom:20px"><strong class="greenstrong" style="font-size: 25px">Career</strong><br><br>
			Scher is one of the most influencial American Graphic Designers in the world. She's well-known for her career in graphic design (primarily creating identity systems), painting, and teaching, and her mission is "I'm always looking for more to design." The 1970's was a life changing decade for Sher as she graduated from the Tyler School of Art, moved to New York City, and began her career working at various companies, such as Random House, CBS Records, and Atlantic Records. During this time, she became famous for her uniquely creative record covers. Throughout her entire career, she is regularly inspired by art history movements, such as Russian Constructivism, Futurism and Art Deco. She has expressed that she has limited talent and that's why she's drawn to typography. She says, "I go through six-month periods of no talent. It's happened throughout my career. I'll be dry for ideas or not happy with what I'm doing. I can usually make up for it with knowledge of design. It's safe work - no mistakes, but no breakthroughs, either."<br><br>
				

In 1984, Scher co-founded Koppel and Scher with Terry Koppel, marking a significant chapter in her career. However, her professional evolution continued as she transitioned to a partnership with Pentagram's New York City Office in 1991, assuming the role of the first female principal. Her contributions to the field of graphic design extended beyond conventional boundaries, as demonstrated by her diverse portfolio, which includes the creation of iconic brand identities for institutions such as the New York Public Theater and The New School. Notably, Scher's creative influence extended beyond commercial endeavors, as evidenced by her impactful work and mentorship in education at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York City, where she served as a professor from 1992 onwards.<br><br>

Scher's artistic journey reached new heights in 2017 when she starred in the Netflix documentary series, "Abstract: The Art of Design," captivating audiences with her innovative approach and profound insights into the world of typography and graphic design. She reveals that she gets the best of her ideas in taxi cabs because she's able to sit back, relax, and be influenced by what she refers to as "the city of signs," New York City. As a visionary leader, Paula Scher's legacy continues to inspire aspiring designers and shape the landscape of graphic design for generations to come.

			<br>
				Russian Constructivism, Futurism, and Dada are clearly represented in Paula Scher's works because that's where she draws her inspiration. More specifically, you can see these three art movements present through the way she incorporates collage, photo montage, bold lettering, and dynamic elements.

			<br>
				Paula Scher met her mentor and husband, Seymour Chwast, at Push Pin Studios, a company he founded in the late 1950s. Seymour is an illustrator and designer and Scher has often times refered to him as her "design hero," especially during her time in art school. Scher and Seymour married in 1973, divorced five years later in 1978, then remarried in 1989 and currently reside in New York City. Even thought they're married, they are unable to collaborate on their work due to their differing opinions and styles.
